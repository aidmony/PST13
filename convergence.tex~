Researchers have long argued that every social network has a tendency
towards balanced states~\cite{Doreian:02}.  The next question of
interest is if an imbalance rises, in what way will a social network
change towards a new balance. We propose a model that characterizes a
social network's convergence process towards balance.

It is noted in social psychology literature that people are reluctant
to make changes in relations as they tend to avoid effort needed to
make such changes. In a balanced triadic relation, participants are
likely to do nothing and keep their pairwise relations as what they
were. In an imbalanced triadic relation, participants are likely to
make the smallest effort possible to regain triadic balance. We define
the concept of relation cost as the effort one needs to take to
accomplish a certain relation change. Our convergence model is
established based on a unified assumption: every social network
converges in a way that requires as little total change in relations
as possible to reach a balanced state.

With the concept of relation distance, we are able to express the
structure of a social network by drawing it in the Euclidean
space. The strength of each relation is expressed by the distance
between their locations. Notice that every layout in the Euclidean
space automatically satisfies the metric triangle inequality, and
hence corresponds to a balanced state of the network.  For an
imbalanced social network, it is not possible to draw it using its
initial relation distances.  Hence, our convergence model aims to
produce a layout of the social network with minimum total relation
cost from the original one.

Let $G=(V,E)$ denote an arbitrary social network, and $G^{*}=(V,
E^{*})$ denote a balanced state of $G$. Let $n*n$ matrix $X$ denote
the layout of $G^{*}$, with each row vector $x_{i}$ denoting node
$i$'s location in $m$-dimensional space. For each pair $(i,j)$,
$\psi(i,j)$ denotes its relation distance in $G$, and $d_{i,j}(X)$
denotes distance between $i$ and $j$ in $X$, i.e., its relation
distance in $G^{*}$.  Given an edge $(i,j)\in E$, we consider the
relation cost on $(i,j)$ is given by:
\[c_{i, j}(X)=w_{\psi(i,j)}*(d_{i,j}(X)-\psi{(i,j)})^2\]
where the weight value is a function of the original distance. The
weight function can take into account the difficulty of changing a
relation. For example, it is generally easier to change a neutral
relation than a positive or negative relation that carries with them
initial bias. The study of optimal weights is beyond the scope of this
paper. However, we consider three main classes of weights:
\[
 w_{\psi(i,j)}= \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{l l}
    w_{+} & \quad \text{if $\psi(i,j)$ is a positive edge}\\
    w_{O} & \quad \text{if $\psi(i,j)$ is a neutral edge}\\
    w_{-} & \quad \text{if $\psi(i,j)$ is a negative edge}\\
  \end{array} \right.
\]

If $w_{O} << w_{+}$ and $w_{O} << w_{-}$, then neutral edges would
have very little influence on the already established
positive/negative relations.

\begin{definition}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a social network where $E$ is a set of weighted
edges. Its converged network $G^{*}=(V,E^{*})$ is given by layout
matrix $X$ with $d_{i,j}(X)$ as the relation distance between every
pair $(i,j)$, such that the total relation cost $\sigma(X)$ is
minimized,
\[\sigma(X)= \min_{X} \sum_{i<j \leq n}w_{\psi(i,j)}*(d_{i,j}(X)-\psi{(i,j)})^2\].

\end{definition}

The optimization of relation cost is in fact a Metric
Multidimensional Scaling problem (MDS) by assigning nodes a location
in metric space. The total cost function is called stress in MDS, and
is often minimized through an optimization strategy called {\it stress
  majorization} \cite {Gansner:05}. Stress majorization is an iterative
method that guarantees monotonically decreasing stress in each
iteration, and returns a locally minimum solution.  It is recognized
as a principled technique in the field of graph drawing. The
algorithm, however, requires $O(n^3)$ time and $O(n^{2})$ space. Due
to its complexity, stress majorization is applicable on graphs with
limited size. We are in the process of developing an approximation
method for this problem as a result. In this paper, however, we will
investigate the performance of the exact solution to stress
majorization.
